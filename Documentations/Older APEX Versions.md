[View Announcement](https://blogs.oracle.com/apex/announcing-oracle-apex-202) [See What's New](https://apex.oracle.com/en/platform/features/whats-new/)

-  
   #### Cards Region
    
   The new Cards Region is a lightweight report region, declaratively supporting customizations of layout, appearance, icon, badge, media and actions. Use cards to embed and share media sourced from BLOB column, URL or video in iFrame. Cards are useful for presenting a variety of information in small blocks. As Cards usually provide entry to more detailed information, you can include a number of actions as button or links declaratively.
    
-  
   #### Automations
    
   Automations are a sequential set of PL/SQL actions, triggered by query results. They are used to monitor data and then perform the appropriate action (examples are auto-approving specific requests and sending email alerts). An automation can be triggered on Schedule or on Demand, by invoking the APEX\_AUTOMATION package. Query results can be derived from: Table or View, SQL Query or a PL/SQL function returning a SQL Query. Local Database or REST Enabled SQL. REST Data Source (aka Web Source Modules).
-  
   #### Faceted Search Enhancements
    
   Faceted Search has been enhanced to generating bar or pie charts of facet value counts, grouping checkbox facets for Boolean columns, supporting comparing user-entered value with the facet column in Input Field facet type and performance optimization for distinct value facets.
    
- 
  #### Report Printing
    
   Built-in PDF printing is supported in Interactive Reports, Interactive Grids and Classic Reports and in Chinese, Japanese and Korean languages. You can attach any download formats in Interactive Report - Send Email. Enhanced integration with BI publisher. Use new APEX\_REGION.EXPORT\_DATA and APEX\_DATA\_EXPORT APIs to programmatically generate PDF, CSV, Excel, HTML, JSON and XML files.
   
- 
#### REST Data Source Synchronization
APEX supports data synchronization from a REST Data Source (formerly known as Web Source Modules) to a local table. Synchronization can run either on Schedule or on Demand, by calling the APEX\_REST\_SOURCE\_SYNC package. Developers don't need to build custom PL/SQL code in order to copy data from REST services to local tables; APEX provides this as a declarative option.
    
- 
    
    #### REST Data Source Connector Plug-Ins
    
    The APEX Plug-In infrastructure has been extended to support Connector Plug-Ins for external REST APIs. This enables APEX to fully leverage REST API features like result pagination or server-side filtering, also for 3rd Party REST Services which are not ORDS or Oracle Fusion SaaS Services.
    
-  
    
    #### New Web Credential Types
    
    APEX 20.2 introduces new URL Query String and HTTP Header types for Web Credentials. This allows developers to use the secure and encrypted credential storage also for REST Services which expect e.g. an API key as part of the URL. APEX makes sure that such sensitive parts are not written to debug or execution logs. A web credential can now be protected by providing a URL pattern. APEX will only use the Web Credential for URLs starting with the given pattern; otherwise an error message will be raised. To change the URL pattern, the secret part of the Web Credential needs to be entered again.
    
-   
    
    #### Redwood UI
    
    Universal Theme now supports a new Redwood Light theme style, available via Theme Roller. Refresh your existing apps to uptake the latest version of Universal Theme and this new theme style.
    
-   
    
    #### Developer Experience
    
    Improved developer experience by introducing multiple tabs in the Property Editor pane in page designer, a new code editor, an embedded code utility and saving a model in Quick SQL.
    
-  
    
    #### New and Improved Items
    
    New checkbox item type. The file browse, rich text editor, text field textarea item types have been improved.
    

### Other Features

-   Tree region type has been enhanced to support lazy loading and refresh without having to reload the full page.
-   New Interactive Grid Saved Report Static ID Support.
