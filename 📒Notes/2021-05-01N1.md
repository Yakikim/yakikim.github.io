# Change DBMS Scheduler


[[HOME]]/[[Open University]]/[[Memos]]

## רקע
Daniel wants to run a Interactive report's subscription that will be run everyday and  will be sent to the users. But the system runs only by Hour and not by Minutes

## פעולות

 so that he offers to update the scheduler : 
 ```sql
BEGIN          

dbms_scheduler.set_attribute(name => 'APEX_200100.ORACLE_APEX_WS_NOTIFICATIONS',

 attribute => 'repeat_interval',

 value => 'FREQ=MINUTELY;BYMINUTE=0,15,30,45;BYSECOND=0');
 END;
```
Another problem is that every subscription run, the system updates the OFFSET_DATE TO hh:00:00  so the scheduler update is not enough. 
Haggit built the program op\_apex\_update\_scheduler\_pkg.update\_scheduler
and I've created the Concurrent [[Open University/OP APEX Update Scheduler]])
